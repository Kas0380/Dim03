								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<p>Numbers have always been my thing, ever since school. I even got a distinction in my Master's degree in Mathematics (honors!). During my academic journey, I published two research papers in international journals, showcasing my ability to draw meaningful conclusions. This journey taught me how to break down complex problems and explain them in a clear, concise way. Numbers have the power to make anything significant or an absolute disaster. Kind of like how changing the digits in your age can completely rewrite your story!</p>

                                <p>But numbers weren't enough on their own. I craved the challenge of using them to understand the world around us. My love for numbers really goes beyond this – I absolutely love analyzing things, I see patterns everywhere, even in nature! To fuel this passion, I've done <a href="index.html#experience">5 internships</a> as a data analyst and business analyst, working on over 15 projects. Being named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7165698044485652480/">"Best Performer"</a> at CognoRise InfoTech during my internship was a huge confidence boost!</p>

                                <p>But the learning doesn't stop there. I've also completed over <a href="https://muskanstinydata.wordpress.com/2024/04/07/learning-is-key-but-projects-take-you-to-the-next-level/">40 personal projects </a> using tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel and Tableau. These projects covered everything from exploring data (EDA), scraping websites to sentiment analysis, optimizing customer engagement and building clear, informative dashboards.</p>

                                <p>Numbers aren't the only things that talk. I believe in the power of clear communication. During a <a href="https://github.com/muskan0830/KultureHire-Internship-Projects/tree/main/STAGE-8">presentation</a> at KultureHire, I was praised for my ability to effectively distill complex data into clear, actionable insights and research skills that exceeded expectations. Sharing my research at international conferences has also been incredibly rewarding, even leading to the publication of one of my papers.</p>

                                <p>Sharing knowledge is my another passion. That's why I started my blog, <a href="https://muskanstinydata.wordpress.com/">"Tiny Data Universe"</a>. It's my way of making data analysis approachable and relatable and showing everyone that data analysis isn't scary - it's actually a fun way to understand the world around us!</p>

                                <p>Here's another thing, data isn't just about numbers - it's about understanding the world and how things work. And that connection between data and success is what drew me to the business world. Just like numbers tell stories, businesses do too! Business itself has become a fascination for me. Plus, I have a whole <a href="https://muskanstinydata.wordpress.com/category/business/">section</a> dedicated to making business ideas easier to understand, because let's face it, business success is a bit like figuring out life itself, right?</p>

                               <p>My math background gave me the analytical muscle memory and the problem-solving skills. It let me dissect data and find the hidden connections and patterns while my experience as a tutor and volunteer taught me to speak the language of people, not just spreadsheets. Because data deserves a voice, not just silence. And my artistic soul? It gave me the ability to see the bigger picture, the depth of meaning beyond the numbers. It makes me see the story, the humor, the life in every dataset. The business knowledge gives me the power to think about what businesses need and not just mindlessly analyze things!</p>

                                <p>So, here I am, <b>Muskan Kashyap</b>, a data analyst/ business analyst who wants to translate the whispers of numbers into actionable stories and to help businesses see the world through their data.</p>

                               <p>If you're looking for a data analyst or a business analyst who can crunch numbers, see the big picture, think about your business and tell a story with them, let's connect!</p>

								<h3>Secrets of Severus Snape: Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis  ||  Python</h3>
								<h3></h3>
								<p>Remember those enchanting Saturday nights, huddled with siblings, bewitched by the cinematic wonders of Harry, Hermione, and Ron? The Harry Potter movies were more than just films; they were the cornerstone of our childhood, weaving a tapestry of friendship, courage, and magic.  From the moment Hagrid uttered those unforgettable words, "You're a wizard, Harry," we were hooked. From the bustling corridors of Hogwarts to the enchanting forbidden forest, the movies were a visual feast. </p>
                                    
									<h4>But how this fits in your puzzle?</h4>
									<p>Businesses crave stories behind their customers, and that's where I come in! Imagine this:
										<ul>
										<li>Want to know how customers *really* feel about your product? I can scrape reviews, analyze the emotions, and aha! You've got a magic potion of insights to improve it.</li>
										<li>Lost in a sea of social media comments? No worries! I can untangle the mess and reveal what people are *truly* saying.</li>
										<li>Stuck in a marketing rut? Fear not! I can decode the most powerful words that resonate with your audience, casting spells of attraction and boosting your brand.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h3>Let's continue this journey!</h3>
									<p></p>	

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>My goal was to unravel the mysteries of Professor Snape from the Harry Potter series using web scraping and sentiment analysis techniques. Through this magical coding adventure, I aimed to understand Snape's emotional landscape and uncover the most enchanted words that defined his story.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Chapter 1: The Sorcery of Web Scraping</h3>
									<p>I employed the art of web scraping to gather Snape's story from a special webpage. Picture it like sending a coded owl to fetch a letter, but instead, we fetched paragraphs filled with Snape's tales. Using magical tools like BeautifulSoup and NLTK, I transformed these paragraphs into a neat scroll, saved in a CSV file.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Chapter 2: The Potion for Sentiment Analysis</h3>
									<p>This is where the real magic happens! I delved into Snape's sentiments using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer potion. By assigning magical labels like 'angry' or 'protective,' I unveiled the emotions that weave through Snape's narrative. The results painted a captivating picture—Snape's worries took the lead, followed by contempt, anger, and a strong sense of protectiveness.</p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Chapter 3: Discovering the Most Magical Words</h3>
									<p>Summoning the top words echoing in digital Hogwarts, I created a playlist of wizarding hits: Snape, Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Lily. It's like decoding Snape's favorite spells. Filtering mundane words and lemmatizing for simplicity, I uncovered the essence of Snape's story.</p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Key Insights: </h3>
									<h4>Snape's Emotional Landscape</h4>
                                    <p>The sentiment analysis potion unveiled the layers of Snape's emotions. From the depths of worry to the heights of
                                     protectiveness, Snape's sentiments paint a portrait of a character as complex as the enchanted dungeons of
                                     Hogwarts.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                     <li>Worry takes the lead with 22.51%, reflecting Snape's perpetual concern in the wizarding saga.</li>
                                     <li>Contempt and anger follow closely at 19.32% and 14.94%, capturing Snape's moments of disdain and frustration.
                                     </li>
                                     <li>Protectiveness stands tall at 10.06%, showcasing the guardian within Snape.</li>
                                      <li>Sarcasm, sacrifice, ambiguity, and affection weave through his narrative, each adding a unique hue to the canvas
                                       of his emotions.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>Snape's Incantations — Top 5 Magical Words</h4>
                                    
                                    <ul>
									  <li>The word 'Snape' appears 703 times. As expected, the enigmatic Potions Master is at the center of his own tale.</li>
                                      <li>Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort make appearances, emphasizing the interconnectedness of Snape's story with the
                                       broader wizarding world.</li>
                                       <li>The name 'Lily' blooms, reminding us of the poignant ties woven into Snape's complex narrative.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Conclusion: </h3>
									<p>In this magical coding journey, Snape's layers unfolded like a digital scroll. The code spilled the tea on Snape's feelings and the words that made him the wizard we love (and maybe secretly roll our eyes at). It's like unlocking the secrets of the Half-Blood Prince himself!</p>

								<h3>Battle of the Streaming Giants: Netflix vs. YouTube || Tableau</h3>
								<h3></h3>

								<p>Ah, Netflix and YouTube, the two titans of our screen time. They're like the sun and moon of the entertainment universe, ruling our nights and days with their endless streams of videos.</p>
									<p>Imagine a cozy armchair, a warm blanket, and a bottomless pit of shows and movies. That's Netflix. It's the land of curated content, where algorithms know your deepest desires before you even do. Want a tearjerker rom-com? Boom, it's there. Craving a documentary about competitive yodeling? Netflix has got you covered (seriously, there's one).</p>
									<p>Now picture a bustling street market, overflowing with sights, sounds, and everything in between. That's YouTube. It's the wild west of videos, where cat videos rub shoulders with educational lectures and conspiracy theories about the Illuminati (don't judge, we've all been down that rabbit hole). You can learn how to knit a scarf, fix a leaky faucet, and literally anything.</p>
									<p>But do you ever wonder who reigns supreme? </p>
									<p>These two titans of streaming have carved their own paths to our eyeballs, offering entertainment, education, and even ways to earn a living. But which one is king (or queen) of the content castle?</p>
									
									<h4 class="major">But how this fits in your puzzle?</h4>
									<p>The epic battle between Netflix and YouTube! Turns out, your business is facing similar showdowns every day!
										Just like I cracked the code on who reigns supreme in the streaming, I can help you decode the mysteries hidden within your own data. This is how I can help you!</p>
									<ul>
										<li><h4>Spot the gold:</h4>I'll show you where the untapped opportunities are hiding in your data, so you can grab them before your competitors do.</li>
										<li><h4>Dodge the traps:</h4>I'll help you identify potential threats early on, so you can steer clear of trouble and keep your business safe.</li>
										<li><h4>Make sense of the numbers:</h4>No more confusing charts and graphs! I'll turn your data into easy-to-understand pictures that even your goldfish can understand (metaphorically speaking, of course!).</li>
										<li><h4>Tell a winning story:</h4>Don't worry if you speak fluent "mumbo jumbo" and your team speaks "marketing jargon." I'll be your trusty translator, turning complex findings into clear, compelling stories that everyone can understand.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h2>Let's continue this journey!</h2>	
									<p></p>	

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>My mission: uncover the revenue streams, user bases, and hidden trends of these streaming giants. I began my data-driven journey using Tableau to answer the burning questions:
										<ul>
										   <li>Who rakes in more cash?</li>
										   <li>Is everyone on YouTube or Netflix?</li>
										   <li>What's the deal with YouTube Premium's meteoric rise?</li>
										   <li>Is Netflix losing ground, or just taking a dramatic detour?</li></ul>
									</p>
									<p>Buckle up, folks, because the results are surprising!</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 1: Revenue Showdown!</h3>
									<p>Netflix may be the heavyweight with $165 billion in total revenue, but YouTube punches back with its massive user base and ad dollars, bringing in a respectable $135 billion. It's like Netflix is the luxurious restaurant with a limited clientele, while YouTube is the bustling street food stall for the masses</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 2: User Uprising</h3>
									<p>YouTube takes the user crown by a landslide (Need numbers? It’s 18 billion!!). More people are jamming to cat videos and learning DIY hacks than settling in for a Netflix marathon (Merely 1 Billion!). It's like everyone has a YouTube account, while Netflix subscriptions are still a special treat.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 3: Premium Powerhouse</h3>
									<p>Remember when everyone laughed at YouTube Premium? Not anymore! Those subscribers shot from 1 million in 2015 to a whopping 80 million in 2022! Talk about a glow-up! This shows that people are willing to pay for ad-free streaming and exclusive content.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 4: Geography Games</h3>
									<p>Turns out, Netflix's biggest fans live in the USA and Canada. Those two countries together are like Netflix's personal ATM. Think red carpets, maple syrup, and endless binge-watching</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 5: The loss Rollercoaster</h3>
									<p>Hold onto your popcorn! Netflix's annual losses took a wild ride between 2018 and 2021, with ups and downs as dramatic as any cliffhanger in "Stranger Things." This just proves that even the streaming giants have to navigate their own challenges</p>

									<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>So, who wins the crown? Well, that's like asking who wins, pizza or tacos? They're both delicious, just in different ways. Netflix is your reliable best friend, always there with a comforting shoulder (or binge-worthy show) when you need it. YouTube is the crazy, unpredictable cousin who introduces you to new and bizarre things you never knew existed. Both YouTube and Netflix rule different parts of the streaming kingdom. One for the masses, one for the discerning, both leaving us entertained, informed, and maybe even a little addicted. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and both are constantly evolving.</p>
									<p>Ultimately, the winner is... you! You get to choose your own adventure, whether it's a carefully curated Netflix marathon or a wild YouTube rabbit hole expedition
									</p>

									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<p>This project was my data-driven adventure into the world of streaming. I used skills like:
										<ul>
										   <li>Data analysis: I wrangled and analyzed data from various sources.</li>
										   <li>Visualization: I turned those numbers into colorful graphs and charts that anyone could understand, even if they can't tell the difference between a bar graph and a pie chart.</li>
										   <li>Storytelling: I made the data come alive with insights and humor, because who wants to read a boring data dump?</li></ul>

								<h3>Turn your Customer Insights into Business Gold! || Excel</h3>
								<h3></h3>

								<p>Imagine you're running a business. Customers are the lifeblood of your company, and keeping them happy is crucial. That's where customer service comes in. It's the magic touch that turns satisfied customers into loyal fans. But how do you know if your customer service is hitting the mark? That's where this project comes in.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>This Excel project is about creating a customer service dashboard that sheds light on what's really happening in the world of your customer support team. It's like having a superhero X-ray for your customer service, letting you see strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities to improve.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Chapters</h3>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>Customer Satisfaction: We peered into the minds of the customers, using star ratings and feedback to gauge their happiness.</li>
											<li>Agent Performance: We tracked the customer service heroes, seeing who consistently delivered smiles and solved problems like a champ.</li>
											<li>Interaction Channels: We examined how customers reach out, whether it's by phone, email, or live chat, to see which methods make them happiest.</li>
											<li>Top Trends: We identified patterns and insights hidden within the data, like which days see the most interactions or which issues cause the most frowns.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Key Insights</h3>
									<p>
										<ol>
											<li>Customer Champions:
												<ul>
													<li>Requests shine: Not only did they win big with a 7.2 out of 10 satisfaction rating, but they also snagged the most customers, with a whopping 53% choosing them. Clearly, Requests keep their fans smiling!</li>
												    <li>Adrien aces it: This superstar agent consistently crushes satisfaction goals, boasting a monthly average of 7.3 out of 10. No wonder customers love him!</li>
												</ul>
											</li>

											<li>Interaction All-Stars:
												<ul>
													<li>Summer surge: June saw the most interactions. Was it a hot product launch or just the summer heat driving things up?</li>
												    <li>Seasonal shifts: Roach Cousineau ruled the summer months, handling the June-August rush like a champ. Adrien took the crown in September, proving this team has all seasons covered!</li>
												</ul>
											</li>

											<li>Deeper Dives:
												<ul>
													<li>August blues: In August, daily satisfaction took a noticeable dip. Time to investigate what happened and turn those frowns upside down!</li>    
												</ul>

											</li>

										</ol>
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>This customer service dashboard is your secret weapon for understanding your customers and delivering the kind of service that makes them sing your praises. Use it to identify areas for improvement, celebrate your star agents, and keep your customers coming back for more. Remember, happy customers are loyal customers, and loyal customers are the key to business success!</p>
